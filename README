DESCRIPTION:

    This program can be used to visualize the Ant System (AS) variant of the
    Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) heuristic to find optimized solutions to 
    the TSP. 

    The controls are as follows:
        r - replay
        n - play new, randomized tour
        p - toggle display pheromone trails
        g - toggle display best greedy algorithm tour
        a - toggle display best-so-far ACO tour

    Blue tour - best greedy algorithm tour
    Green tour - best-so-far ACO tour
